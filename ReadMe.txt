This is a little tool for visualizing what notes belong to what key
currently works for both guitar and violin in standard tuning, for major and minor scales

user selects instrument, scale type, and key; notes within that key are highlighted on a virtual guitar neckboard

just download the zip, extract to a folder, and open /src/html/interface.html with a browser, no internet necessary.
